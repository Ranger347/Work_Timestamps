# Work Timestamps

## Why create this project?

At my summer work, we use a telephone as our time clock, so there is very little way to find out how many hours you have worked over the week since there is no online portal to see (or I just do not know about it). Therefore, I kept track of my hours manually recording what hours I worked on my phone; however, it is very easy to miscalculate when keeping track of individual timestamps, so I created this program to keep track of and sum up how many hours I have worked over the week.

## What does the project do?

This project has many programs (which all do the same thing is different languages) in which the user inputs times for each day they have worked and the program outputs the amount of time the person has worked over the week. Additionally, the user can input their wage per hour and the program can output their pay for the period.
